## BINF_AVDA
BINF final project AVDA (Advanced Visualization for Data 

This is the finished project of BINF capstone. The objective of this project is to create an app that takes the user’s input files in a table format (.csv file). The user can visualize the data uploaded and manipulate the data frame on the interface, such as the deletion of rows and columns or transposing the data. A series of options are offered in checkboxes or dropdown menus for the user to choose the distance matrix calculation methods to make the association of the dimensions of their data. Users can plot dendrogram and NMDS (non-metric multidimensional scaling) to visualize the similarity between the samples of interest and form clusters to group the closely related samples together. The app also can log the steps of the user’s interaction as a reference for future reproducibility propose.
